comments:-
=========
			to document a code 
			
types:-
			1. single-line comments  : //
			2. multi-line
								/*
								...
								...
								...
								*/
								
			3. JAVADoc comments /**

variable :-
========		it's a namespace location in a a memory where the 				data values are going to be stored.
				It's a prime unit data storage.
				
				e.g :-
				variable decl:-
				
				Syntax:-
							acc_sp. datatype nameof_var;
							

				e.g:		int roll; //var decl.

							roll = 101; //var initialization
							
							
							int marks=45; //decl. + initial.
							
							
datatype :- specifies the type of data hold by that var..
	
		Types: 1. Fundamental/Primitive (8)
					1. byte 	(1 byte)	// to store  integral values
					2. short 	(2 byte)
					3. int 		(4 bytes)
					4. long 	(8 bytes)
					
					5. float 	(4 bytes) //used to store floating values
					6. double 	(8 bytes)
					
					7. char 	(2 bytes) (based on unicode char-set)
					8. boolean  (true/false) //a boolean value- default - floating
					
			   2. Reference type
							
					1. Class
					2. Arrays
					3. Interfaces
					4. enumerations		
				
Types of variables:=
==================
		1. Instance var:  The variable which was declared/created under the declaration of a class such var  are called as instance var.
			Every object of a class will hold a separate of such var.
			
		2. static variable:
							are those variable whose only one copy exists in a memory and is shared by all the objects of that class.
							
							If one object do some chnages inside it , the another will get changes reflected.
							
							They declared  with static keyword.
		3. Local variable:
							var. which are created inside the block of a code,methods,const. methods.  & their scope is upto only that methods/block.
							
							
To store strings JAVA provides a class 'String' -present inside java.lang package							.

Packages :- Theay prefixe with two keywords: 1 java			
											 2. javax

																								Fundamental package java : - java.lang
																								This is the package which we do not need to import in our java fle,
																					              compiler automatically import this package classes during bytecod 	gen.        			    
   																							In JAVA	Se-7:-
																										we can add underscore literal :for increase the readability
																								e.g.		
				int id =8679_4567_3456;
										
Escape seq:-
==========
		 non-printitng characters which is usd in a string
		 
		 start with '\'
		 e.g . \n - newline
			   \t - tabspace
			   \' - single quotes
			   
User _ input in JAVA:- 
====================
						1. Scanner class	
						2. command-line args
						3. I/O classes
						
						
						To accept a input from the user at runtime java provides a Scanner class - present inside java.util package
						They store the inputs  in terms of tokesn & to read a value from that tokens they provide everal method to us.

						next() - for string value
						nextInt()- int 
						nextLong() - long
						nextFloat() - float
						nextDouble()- double
						nextBool()-------
						............
						...............
